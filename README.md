+ Compile with JDK 1.8!




+ Grade 4 remarks:

I haven't changed anything in the Controller (or Model). I have simply added the SwingView implementation.
The play loop (while-loop in the Program) is still there which of course is not optimal. But I wanted to show that
it is possible to implement a GUI version with little to no changes.
